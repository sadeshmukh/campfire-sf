          We are excited to see your child at Campfire SF! Our team has ran over 5 of these events, and spent months
          planning everything to a T.
        </p>

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
          Campfire SF is a 24 hours event where students come together to code, make friends, and have fun! Campfire SF
          is part of a larger event through the nonprofit Hackclub, where gamjams will take place in over 200 cities
          worldwide on the same day.
        </p>

        <h3>What will my child be doing?</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the event, students will be brainstorming, coding, and developing games in groups of up to 4.
          There will be workshops, project updates, and fun brain breaks.
        </p>

        <h3>How are they kept safe?</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone at the event will be between the ages of 13 and 18, and under adult supervision the whole time.
          Participants will not be able to leave the venue, and none except for parents/guardians will be allowed to
          enter.

          <h3>Logistics.</h3>
          <p>
            Campfire SF will take place at 35 S Park St, San Francisco, CA 94107. The event will open at 11 Saturday
            morning, and end Sunday at 1 PM. Waivers will be sent out in the weeks leading up to the event.
          </p>
          <h3>Is it free?</h3>
